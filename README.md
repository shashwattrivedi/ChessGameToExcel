# ChessGameToExcel
Converts Chess game into Excel sheets of chess board position

## How to run
```
python GameToExcel.py [-h] moves_file_path pieces_dir game_dir
```
Example
```
python .\GameToExcel.py "Opera\Game.txt" "ChessPiecesCsv" "Opera"

The Excel file `game.xlsm` in `game_dir` will have the entire game converted to excel worksheets.

I don't know why I made this, but it was good learning and experimentation with python libraries and VBA scripting.

Enjoy your game in excel.
